# How to add new languages?
There are several ways to add new languages. 

* Add a new resource file to an existing resource file in your Visual Studio solution, adding the culture name as a suffix, for example: Resource.es.resx for Spanish. RESX Manager then automatically adds the new language to the list of languages.
* When texts have been exported to Excel, just enter the corresponding culture abbreviation to a new column. When importing the Excel file, RESX Manager automatically adds the new language to the list of languages.
